# ui-library

A component library based on [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for all things lagoon related:

## Installation 💾

Install it in a React project with a single npm/yarn command:

```bash
npm install github:uselagoon/ui-library#main tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```

```bash
yarn add github:uselagoon/ui-library#main tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```

Alternatively, add the following to your `package.json` and run `npm i` / `yarn` command:

```json
   "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18",
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.1.8",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.1.10",
    "ui-library": "github:uselagoon/ui-library#main",
  }

```

Make sure to add generated dist styles from the ui-library like so, preferably in the root layout of your project:

```tsx
import '@uselagoon/ui-library/dist/ui-library.css';
```

## Usage 🔨

Using a component from the library:

```tsx
import '@uselagoon/ui-library/dist/ui-library.css';
import { Button, SwitchWithDescription } from '@uselagoon/ui-library';


export default () => (
  <>
    <Button variant="ghost">A spooky disabled button</Button>
    <SwitchWithDescription
      description="This is a switch description."
      id="first"
      label="Switch Text"
    />
  </>
```

## Vite config ⚙︎

The ui-library is bootstrapped with Vite and TS. To modify the configuration, edit `vite.config.ts` in the root directory; To modify TypeScript rules, refer to `tsconfig.app.json`

## Linting and bundling

### Linting 🧶

The linter is configured for both JS and TypeScript files. It runs during the build step but can also be ran during development by `npm run lint`.

To adhere to formatting rules, run `npm run format`.

To configure the linter config, refer to eslint.config.js at the root of the project.

### Bundling 📦

After making changes to the source files, make sure to run `npm run bundle` command which empties the dist folder and generates updated code for components.

## Viewing storybook 👀

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm i && npm run storybook`
- Visit `http://localhost:6006/`

## Development guide 🏗️

Clone the repo locally:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/uselagoon/ui-library .
  npm install
  npm run storybook
```

It is recommended to build components in isolation with the help of storybook (currently V 9.0).

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

The project structure is as follows:

├── src
│ ├── components # React source code and demos (which then get bundled)
│ ├── hooks # Custom hooks
│ ├── providers # Custom theme and NextLink providers
│ ├── stories # Storybook stories
│ ├── index.css # Autogenerated tailwind css file
│ └── index.ts # Entrypoint for your `exported` components (that your project then imports)
├── eslint.config.js # Eslint config
├── vite.config.ts # Vite bundler config
└── package.json

Given that there's a storybook instance running, navigate to the `src` directory and modify/create new components with their respective `stories.tsx` files.

To add a new component from Shadcn, refer to this [guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli)

Modify and customize anything with Tailwind and/or custom css files if needed.

Then run the lint and format scripts, then ultimately, the bundle script and you're ready to go!

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run bundle
```
